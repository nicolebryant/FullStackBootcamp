Specify a command: new, list, delete, quit
new: "Add new item: " <add list> - returns "<add list> added to list"
list: Shows list of to dos
delete: select index to be deleted
quit: quits the app

anything besides these will only cause initial prompt to come up
store to-dos in an array
use a while not quit loop
