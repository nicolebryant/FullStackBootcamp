The DOM: Document Object Model
    - A JS representation of a webpage
    - it's JS "window" into the contents of a webpage from JS
    - object that are able to be interacted with via JS

JS with HTML/CSS on webpages allows more interactive changes to the webpage for users

the DOM consists of a bunch of objects - when a webpage is loaded using JS, the elements are processed into JS objects and added to a tree structure to organize their relationship on a page
    the top of these trees is the document
the document object is our entry point into the world of the DOM. It contains representations of all the contents on a page
plus tons of useful methods and properties


console.dir

Selecting methods
    There are several methods to select specific elements on the document that allow us to manipulate it
    these functions all exist on the document (DOM) object
    document.getElementById(elementId):  Takes a string param that corresponds to an id on an element and returns the element object with that id. If no element has the specified id, null is returned
        ex.document.getElementById("toc"); //returns "table of contents" element object with 'toc' as an id
    
    document.getElementsByTagName(tagName): Takes a string param corresponding to a tag name (ex. p, img, div) and returns an HTMLCollection of any html objects with matching tag names
        A collection is Not an Array so available functions are different
            square brackets, indices will work (all elements have indices in the HTMLCollection)
            HTMLCollections are iterable so for...of etc will work
            note: this is a collection of HTML objects not strings or dom objects

    document.getElementsByClassName(className): Takes a string param corresponding to a class name and returns an HTML Collection of any html objects with matching class name; if there are none an empty HTML Collection is returned

Query Selector
    Newer, all-in-one methods to select a single element or multiple elements
    document.querySelector(cssStyleSelector): Takes a selector ('tagName', '.className', '#idName', '#img:nth-of-type(2)', etc.) and returns the first matching element

    document.querySelectorAll(cssStyleSelector): Takes a selector and returns a list of html objects
